# TimeSeries-Sales-Forecasting
# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project utilizes historical sales data to forecast future sales using advanced time series analysis techniques. The goal is to generate accurate sales predictions and provide actionable insights that can inform sales strategy and decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Statsmodels, Prophet, Matplotlib
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and visualization
- **Tableau**: For additional data visualization and dashboarding

## Models Used
- **ARIMA**: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
- **SARIMA**: Seasonal ARIMA for data with seasonality
- **Prophet**: Developed by Facebook for flexible time series forecasting

## Skills Demonstrated
- Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Model Evaluation and Tuning
- Statistical Analysis and Trend Identification

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the sales data, handling missing values, and transforming it for time series analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing sales trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the dataset.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Applying ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet models to the data.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
4. **Visualization**: Presenting sales trends and forecasted values through Tableau dashboards and Python visualizations.

## Key Findings and Insights
- Seasonal patterns in sales trends were identified, with spikes during certain periods.
- The SARIMA model was able to capture seasonal trends more accurately compared to ARIMA.
- Prophet provided a robust forecast for sales with both trend and seasonality components.

## Outcome
- Accurate sales forecasts for the upcoming quarters were generated.
- Actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing sales strategies were provided based on the forecast results.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the necessary libraries:
